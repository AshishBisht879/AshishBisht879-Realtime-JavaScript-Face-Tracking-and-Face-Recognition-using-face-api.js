# Realtime JavaScript Face Tracking and Face Recognition using face-api.js


Face-api.js has brought a JavaScript API for face detection and face recognition in the browser implemented on top of the tensorflow.js core API. 

There are several models available with face-api.js, including face detection, face landmark detection, face recognition, facial expression recognition, age estimation, and gender recognition.

To use the API methods first of all these models need to be 
loaded.

In this Project face tracking with the expression, recognition is implemented over the live video stream.
For face recognition, the client has to upload an image. (for this project it can only identify the person whose images are present in the labeled_images folder)
